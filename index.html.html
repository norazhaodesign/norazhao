  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Glitch Room is an interactive website where users can design a 3D model and view it through VR, or visit and redesign existing models.</p>
    <p>The project is situated in the context of glitch art. Using computer code as a design medium and z-fighting as methodology, it generates unique patterns every millisecond and displays them on-screen with a flickering effect.</p>
    <p>A control panel is implemented to allow customisation of the geometries while the 3D rendering mechanism produces personalised fit-to-screen graphic output. The digital platform enables the audience to create and experience a unique artwork which they personally devised.</p>
